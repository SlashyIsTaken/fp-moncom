**MonCOM brings up your entire multi-monitor workspace in one click.**

Describe once which apps and dashboards go where, across every display, and save it as a preset. MonCOM opens each one, positions it exactly, and can log it in for you. Run it on demand, or automatically when Windows starts.

Built for ops walls, dashboard kiosks, and any setup that's more than a couple of windows.

## What is MonCOM?

MonCOM (Monitor Commander) turns a wall of monitors into a single, repeatable command center. You describe your workspace once: which apps and dashboards go where, across every display. Save it as a preset, then bring the whole thing up with one click, or automatically when Windows boots.

It doesn't just open windows in the right place. Each zone can **log itself in, dismiss a startup dialog, and navigate to the right view** by replaying a sequence you record once. A six-screen ops wall, a monitoring kiosk, or a fixed trading layout comes up fully positioned and fully signed in, with no one at the keyboard.

It's built for the set-it-up-once, run-it-daily crowd: NOC and ops walls, dashboard kiosks, streaming rigs, and anyone whose workspace is more than a couple of windows.

---

## Why not just FancyZones?

If you want to drag a window into a zone while you work, use [PowerToys FancyZones](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys/fancyzones). It's free, excellent, and MonCOM doesn't try to replace it.

MonCOM solves a different problem. FancyZones helps you place a window **you've already opened**. MonCOM **opens the windows for you**: the right apps and URLs, on the right monitors, in the right zones. Then it drives them past the login screen, on demand or on boot. One is a snapping tool. The other brings up an entire workspace, repeatably, with no clicks.

| | FancyZones / DisplayFusion | MonCOM |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Snap a window you opened into a zone | ✅ | — |
| Launch the apps & dashboards themselves | — | ✅ |
| Position them across multiple monitors in one action | partial | ✅ |
| Auto-login / click-through, per window | — | ✅ |
| Bring the whole setup up on boot | — | ✅ |

If your workspace is "snap my editor next to my browser," that's FancyZones. If it's "bring up my whole wall, logged in, every morning," that's MonCOM.

## Features

### Monitor Detection
MonCOM detects all connected displays and reads their resolution, position, scale factor, and primary status. No manual setup needed.

### Layout Editor
Split any monitor into zones using built-in templates:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Full Screen** | Entire monitor as a single zone |
| **2 Columns** | Vertical 50/50 split |
| **2 Rows** | Horizontal 50/50 split |
| **2×2 Grid** | Four equal quadrants |
| **3×3 Grid** | Nine equal cells |
| **Main + Side** | 70/30 split for a primary + sidebar workflow |

Each zone can be assigned either:
- **A URL** opens in a frameless browser window, positioned on the zone.
- **An application** launches and moves into position.

### Auto-Login & Action Playback (the headline feature)
This is what sets MonCOM apart from a plain window-snapping tool. After assigning content to a zone, you can record a click and keyboard sequence that MonCOM replays every time that zone launches. The window doesn't just open in position; it arrives logged in and ready. Use it for:
- Logging into a web dashboard
- Clicking through a startup dialog
- Navigating to a specific tab or view
- Typing into search fields or forms

Click **Record** in the zone editor's Automation section. MonCOM closes any open zones, runs a countdown, then launches the zone's content, so the real startup time is captured. Switch to the launched window, perform your actions, then return and click **Stop** (the stop click isn't recorded). Recorded actions cover mouse clicks, keystrokes, scroll, and the timing between steps. Coordinates are stored relative to the zone, so sequences stay valid across resolution changes. You can also add "type text" actions by hand, and set a per-zone launch delay when the content needs more time to load.

### Presets
Save any layout as a named preset. Apply it later with a single click from the dashboard or presets page. MonCOM tracks how many zones each preset has and when it was created.

### Dashboard
A central overview of your monitors and presets with quick-action buttons:
- **New Layout** opens the editor.
- **Close All** closes every launched zone window at once.
- **Refresh Monitors** re-detects displays after you plug in or rearrange them.

### Settings
- **Launch on startup** registers MonCOM to start with Windows.
- **Minimize to tray** keeps MonCOM running in the background.
- **Auto-launch preset** applies a saved preset when MonCOM starts.
- **Run as administrator** lets MonCOM launch apps that need elevated privileges. When it's on, MonCOM asks for administrator permission each time it starts.

### System Tray Integration
MonCOM lives in your system tray. Double-click the icon or use the context menu to show or hide the main window without closing the app.

## Installation

### From a Release

1. Head to the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Download the latest build:
   - **MonCOM-Setup-`<version>`.exe** is the installer. Pick this one if you want MonCOM in your Start menu and automatic updates.
   - **MonCOM-Portable-`<version>`.exe** is the portable build. It runs as a single file with no install, but it does not auto-update.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts, or just run the portable `.exe`.

#### About the SmartScreen warning

MonCOM is not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may say "Windows protected your PC" the first time you run it. That is expected for an unsigned app, not a sign that anything is wrong. To run it, click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

A code-signing certificate is on the roadmap; until then, verifying the checksum (below) is the way to confirm your download is genuine.

#### Verifying your download

Every release publishes a `checksums.txt` with the SHA256 hash of each file. To check the file you downloaded matches:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\MonCOM-Setup-<version>.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the printed hash against the matching line in `checksums.txt`. If they match, the download is intact.

### From Source

See [Building from Source](#building-from-source) below.

## Getting Started

### 1. Launch MonCOM
Open the app. The **Dashboard** shows every monitor connected to your system along with any presets you've saved.

### 2. Create a Layout
Click **New Layout** (or navigate to the **Layout Editor** from the sidebar).

1. Select a monitor from the monitor map at the top of the editor.
2. Choose a split template (e.g., 2 Columns).
3. Click on a zone to configure it:
   - Pick **URL** and enter a web address, or
   - Pick **App** and browse for an executable.
4. Repeat for additional monitors or zones.

### 3. Test It
Click **Quick Apply** to launch all configured zones immediately. MonCOM positions each window pixel-perfect inside its zone. Use **Close All** to tear everything down.

### 4. Save as a Preset
Give your layout a name and click **Save Preset**. It now appears on the Dashboard and the Presets page for one-click access.

### 5. Record Actions (Optional)
With a zone selected that has content assigned, scroll down to the **Automation** section:

1. Click **Record**. MonCOM closes any open zones and starts a 3-second countdown.
2. After the countdown, the zone's content launches so the real startup delay is captured.
3. Interact with the launched content: click buttons, type text, navigate menus.
4. Return to MonCOM and click **Stop Recording**. The stop click is automatically excluded.
5. Your actions appear in a list. Use **Play** to test them, or **Clear** to start over.
6. You can also manually add "type text" actions for entering text strings.

Actions are saved with the preset and replay automatically after the zone content launches.

### 6. Automate
In **Settings**, enable **Launch on startup** and pick your preset under **Auto-launch preset**. Your entire workspace is set up automatically every time Windows starts, including action sequences.
